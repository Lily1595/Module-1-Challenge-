# Editing HTML and CSS for accessibility 

## Description

The motivtion for this project was to edit existing HTML and CSS code to make the website more accessible and to improve SEO. Accessibility is becoming increasingly important and a file which reads as 'div soup' is not accessible, both to people who want an audio description of the website and to other coders. I learnt how to structure HTML files semantically and how to netaen up the CSS code, following the 'scout's rule'.
